# personalized_video_suggestion
Personalized Video Summarization. Where given an android app, the user can watch selected youtube videos and then group them into different clusters (just like bookmarking). These user preferences are learnt by the clustering algorithm to adjust the boundaries of clusters so that better video suggestions could be given to the user.
